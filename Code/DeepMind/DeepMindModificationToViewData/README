These files have been added or modified from the DeepMind Control Suite
in order to view cart position and pole angle data for 8 cart pole systems
using the viewer. This was done by importing the data using: numpy.load , on 
".npy" files containing data for each agent. 

This data is a 3D array where axis 0 is time, axis 1 is the agent number 
(8 of them), and axis 2 is the single agent's states. State 0 is cart 
position, state 1 is cart velocity, state 2 is pole angle, and state 3 
is pole velocity. 

To use the viewer, the cart postion and pole angle are directly sent to 
control the cart. Though this is not the intended use, this allows us to 
visualize the data over time. Once the program is run, a viewer window is 
opened and this window can be recorded or screenshotted for use. In order 
to start and stop the simulation, press the space key when the window is active.


In order for this to work, there must be multiple files in the DeepMind 
Control Suite that are modified. In order to easily return to the standard 
DeepMind Control Suite, all of the code that was changed was added and old
code was commented out so that it can be uncommented later. Instructions 
and paths for these files are described below.



Instructions on using files:

	Navigate to: "Your Python Install"\Lib\site-packages\dm_control\suite

	Replace: __init__.py and copy cartpole_2.py, cart_pole_states.npy, and cartpole_2.xml into this folder

	Navigate to: "Your Python Install"\Lib\site-packages\dm_control\rl

	Replace: control.py and cart_pole_states.npy in this folder

	Run: DeepMind_ViewingCartPole.py
